# LXD Debian Package

Due to many issues using snap, wich made the awesome lxd package nearly unusable
we decided to package lxd as a debian package, inspired by: https://salsa.debian.org/mjeanson/lxd

The package is locally built, [following the official build instructions](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/installing/).
