Description: lxc prior to version 4.0.12 had a logic bug in do_lxcapi_create() that returned success in error conditions. Since this is a very simple test, that didnâ€™t actually matter, but now to properly pass would require the setting up of a user-specific lxc configuration and sub[u|g]id mappings, which is just too much effort for a small test.
