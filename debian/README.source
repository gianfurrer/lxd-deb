The lxd-agent binary is compiled as a statically-linked executable. This is done
because if it is available on the host system, LXD will automatically copy the
lxc-agent binary into new virtual machines that are created. Statically-linking
it will allow execution within any arbitrary Linux vm that a user may create.

I encountered this in my initial packaging of LXD for Debian, and the Gentoo
folks have also run into this: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=752480
